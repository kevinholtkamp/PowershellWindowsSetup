# PowershellWindowsSetup
I decided to make a public version of my Powershell script for setting up Windows after installation.
I decided to do this so that other people can benefit from this, and also because I wanted to learn more about how git/GitHub works in respect to Pull requests, forks and other things.

The script is set up in a way where you edit/add files in the subfolders, or edit the setup.ini instead of editing the script directly.
In that way you can set up your files and have them work with new versions of the script.
Additionally, I try to create the script in such a way that you can run it again at a later date without breaking anything.
